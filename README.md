I'm an aspiring Python software developer with a background in business process automation via Robotic Process Automation (RPA).

This GitHub documents my learning journey as I strengthen my foundations in Python, problem-solving, and software development best practices. Here, you’ll find coursework, practice exercises, and projects that reflect my growth as a developer.
